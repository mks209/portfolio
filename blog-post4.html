                        <div class="article-meat">
                            <p>You know that moment when your scrolling through Facebook and suddenly that pair of shoes you were going buy in your last online shopping sesh pop up? <br><br>
                                After browsing for hours, you had found the perfect pair of boots and eagerly threw them into your digital shopping cart.<br><br>
                                
                                But a generous dose of buyer’s remorse (and whole lot of common sense about your student budget) quickly jumped into your head! <br><br>
                                
                                You became one of the 69.5% of online shoppers who abandon their cart. <br><br>
                                Except then… two days later a Facebook ad pops up to remind you of those beautiful boots you “left behind” and offers a 20% discount! <br><br>
                                Perhaps you and the oots are meant to be after all? <br><br>
                                This all-too-common scenario demonstrates the power of retargeting - the process of marketing to someone who’s already visited your website with the aim of enticing them back to make purchase. <br><br>
                                Facebook is just one of the tools that allows marketers to use analytics and tracking technologies to retarget customers. <br><br>
                                The ads on Facebook use what’s called the “Facebook Pixel”. This is a code embedded into websites which uses cookies to connect a consumer’s online behaviour to their Facebook profile. <br><br>
                                By using tracking tools like the Facebook Pixel and pairing them with insights from data, marketers can create personalized communications that bring consumers back to the firm. <br><br>
                                They may even reunite a consumer with that lonely, abandoned cart they left behind. <br><br>
                                Ultimately, retargeting can benefit everyone: consumers might get a discount or free shipping on a product they have expressed interest in, and brands are able to secure sales that could have been lost otherwise.
