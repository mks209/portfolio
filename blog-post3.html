                                        <p>Google has plans to bring audio content to the forefront of search engine results and it could make podcasts a crucial ingredient in SEO strategies.<br><br>

                                            Talking with Pacific Content, Google Podcasts Product Manager Zack Reneau-Wedeen described the company’s plans to bring audio content on par with other search results like text, video and images.<br><br>
                                            
                                            The company has already started to surface individual podcast episodes in the search page.<br><br>  
                                            
                                            Currently, episodes will only be featured in a search if “podcast” is included as a keyword.<br><br>
                                            
                                            But Mr Reneau-Wedeen hinted that in the future Google may be able to understand when topics are being discussed and where it would be appropriate to rank the podcast or even provide snippets of the audio on a search page.<br><br>  
                                            
                                            <em>What does this mean for marketers?</em><br><br>
                                            
                                            Every expert in SEO will tell you that content is king, but it’s written content that still rules.<br><br>
                                            
                                            On average, the highest ranking Google search result contains around 1,890 words and websites with a blog have around 55% more visitors.<br><br> 
                                            
                                            Search engines largely rely on keywords to index websites and we know written content and metadata increase the ability to include keywords at a higher frequency. <br><br>
                                            
                                            If Google is able to effectively “read” and understand podcast content, then they could convert the audio into searchable text and index the content of every podcast episode in a similar way as written articles or pages. <br><br>
                                            
                                            In Google’s future, your podcast could show up when people search for a question or topic that you have talked about. Google may even understand specific topics in each episode, allowing users to skip to this section. <br><br>
                                            
                                            Corporate Brands have already jumped on the podcast bandwagon; Bumble talks all things relationship in Love etc.and Ikea helps you nap with the Ikea Sleep Podcast.<br><br>
                                            
                                            If Google continues their focus on building podcasts into search results, this could become a crucial element to ensuring your company’s website makes it onto the search page and may challenge written content. <br><br>
                                            
                                            The next time someone googles “How to fall in love”, they could be directed to playing a section of Bumble’s podcast answering this query, in turn driving traffic to the dating apps website and (given the nature of the topic) they could even end up downloading the app itself.
