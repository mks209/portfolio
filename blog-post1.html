            <h1>The allure of campaign based microsites and why you should get one</h1>

                        <p>Although well-established mediums like blogs and email continue to thrive in the content marketing arena, more innovative and creative methods have inevitably emerged.
                            One of the forms that has cut through this content marketing revolution is microsites.<br><br>
                            These are smaller, focussed websites with a limited number of pages that often live outside of the company/brands official URL or domain and function as a separate entity.<br><br>
                            Microsites can be used to launch specific campaigns and I believe they are particularly effective when they incorporate elements of interactive experiences.<br><br>
                            81% of marketers agree that interactive content holds the attention of consumers more effectively than static content and this can also enhance the retention of brand messaging.<br><br>
                            
                            A classic example of an interactive microsite is Office Max’s Elf Yourself campaign, which lets consumers attach their faces to dancing elves on a dedicated site.<br><br>
                            
                            The simple concept became a huge viral success in 2006 and has since extended into a special app, cementing itself as a Christmas tradition for many.<br><br> 
                            
                            A more recent example comes from the website page Hypebeast hosted for the launch of the Adidas Ozweego sneakers.<br><br>
                            
                            This was designed to be a ‘website’ from the future year of 2048 and featured an interactive scroll through a tech-like tunnel with news headlines of future predictions.<br><br>
                            The Ozweego microsite supported a futuristic campaign for the new shoes based on their style and was able to cement this brand message in consumers’ minds in a more fun, engaging and memorable way compared to static content like a written article.<br><br>
                            Check out the Ozweego website and let me know what you think:<br>
                            <em>Is this content effective or should companies stick to traditional forms like blogging and social media?</em>
                            <em>Do you know of any other successful microsites?</em> 
                            </p>
